            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>For this assignment, I was asked to spend 24 hours only using a mobile browser to document my experience with different mobile sites. </p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>No, I was able to see what I wanted to see an almost every site. Some mobile sites have less info then desktop sites.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>I was always able to find what I wanted when mobile browsing.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>With mobile browsing I did not have as much fredom as with desktop browsing. On desktop browsing, I am able to see more at once and do more at once.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Some drop down scroll tabs did not work properly. Most the time it opens up an ios scroll wheel on the iphone. On gamedebate.com, some of their scroll wheels on mobile did not work properly.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Some sites loaded a lot faster on mobile than on desktop because of the simplicity.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>After doing this 24hr test, I was able to notice that some mobile sites are really good and some are really poor. The mobile compatibility of sites is pretty broad, just like normal desktop sites. Some sites will perform better than others.</p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
